# Brief Introduction to Elm

This is material for a lightning talk on Elm.

This is not a comprehensive introduction to Elm, and it's probably not very
useful at all without me (or someone) presenting it.

The presentation itself is in `elm-intro.org` and is designed to be delivered
using [the Emacs `org-present` package](https://github.com/rlister/org-present).
