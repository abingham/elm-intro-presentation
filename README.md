# Brief Introduction to Elm

This is material for a lightning talk on Elm.

This is not a comprehensive introduction to Elm, and it's probably not very
useful at all without me (or someone) presenting it.

The presentation itself is in `elm-intro.org` and is designed to be delivered
using [the Emacs `org-present` package](https://github.com/rlister/org-present).

This works with Elm 0.18. To run the examples, it's probably simplest to just
use elm-reactor:

```
cd examples
elm-reactor
```
